    <h6>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS Hermann Sudermann</h6>

    <h4 class="name FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        There! Now she can come--curtains, bedding--everything
        fresh and clean as new! No, this honor, this unexpected honor--! Barons
        and counts have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes
        sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about
        them--they're just like--that!--But a princess--a real princess!
    </p>

    <h4 class="name ROSA">ROSA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h4>
    <p class="direction">[_Indignantly._]</p>
    <p class="speech">What? What do you mean by that!</p>

    <h4 class="name ROSA">ROSA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to an
        inn like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and
        velvets. You just wait and see; it's a trick!
    </p>

    <h4 class="name FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine;
        that the letter is a forgery?
    </p>

    <h4 class="name ROSA">ROSA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
        student, Herr Str端bel, he's always joking.
    </p>
    <p class="direction">[_Giggles._</p>

    <h4 class="name FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        When Herr Str端bel makes a joke he makes a decent joke, a
        real, genuine joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to be angry
        sometimes--but as for writing a forged letter--My land!--a letter with a
        gold crown on it--there!
    </p>
    <p class="direction">
        [_She takes a letter from her waist and
        reads._]
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
        "This afternoon Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern, will
        stop at the Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the
        descent to the Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and
        comfortable room, to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances, and,
        above all, to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event, as
        otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness von Brook, maid
        of honor to Her Highness." Now, what have you got to say?
    </p>

    <h4 class="name ROSA">ROSA.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Herr Str端bel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
        too. I'm sure it's a trick!
    </p>

    <h4 class="name FRAULINDEMANN">FRAU LINDEMANN.</h4>
    <p class="direction">[_Looking out toward the back._]</p>
    <p class="speech">Dear, dear, isn't that
        Herr Str端bel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
        does he always want up here?</p>
