    <h6>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS Hermann Sudermann</h6>

    FRAU LINDEMANN. There! Now she can come--curtains, bedding--everything
    fresh and clean as new! No, this honor, this unexpected honor--! Barons
    and counts have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes
    sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about
    them--they're just like--that!--But a princess--a real princess!

    ROSA. Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.

    FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Indignantly._] What? What do you mean by that!

    ROSA. I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to an
    inn like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and
    velvets. You just wait and see; it's a trick!

    FRAU LINDEMANN. Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine;
    that the letter is a forgery?

    ROSA. Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
    student, Herr Str端bel, he's always joking. [_Giggles._

    FRAU LINDEMANN. When Herr Str端bel makes a joke he makes a decent joke, a
    real, genuine joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to be angry
    sometimes--but as for writing a forged letter--My land!--a letter with a
    gold crown on it--there! [_She takes a letter from her waist and
    reads._] "This afternoon Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern, will
    stop at the Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the
    descent to the Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and
    comfortable room, to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances, and,
    above all, to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event, as
    otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness von Brook, maid
    of honor to Her Highness." Now, what have you got to say?

    ROSA. Herr Str端bel lent me a book once. A maid of honor came into that,
    too. I'm sure it's a trick!

    FRAU LINDEMANN. [_Looking out toward the back._] Dear, dear, isn't that
    Herr Str端bel now, coming up the hill? To-day of all days! What on earth
    does he always want up here?
